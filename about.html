                    <p class="card-text">
                        E-waste is harmful because it contains toxic materials like lead, mercury, and cadmium, which
                        pollute soil, water, and air. Improper disposal causes serious health issues, including
                        respiratory problems and organ damage. Burning e-waste releases harmful fumes, contributing to
                        climate change. Many workers, especially in developing countries, handle e-waste unsafely,
                        risking severe illnesses. Children are highly vulnerable to its effects. Poor recycling leads to
                        resource wastage and environmental damage. The growing e-waste crisis worsens global warming.

                        Safe disposal of e-waste is necessary to prevent pollution. Various methods such as
                        incineration,
                        recycling, and landfill disposal are used to manage e-waste efficiently.

        <h3 class="headings">About E-Waste Awareness</h3>

        <p>
            Welcome to our E-Waste Awareness section, where we aim to educate and
            raise awareness about the importance of responsible e-waste management.
            Electronic waste, or e-waste, is a growing concern due to its adverse
            impact on the environment and human health. When improperly disposed of,
            e-waste releases hazardous substances such as lead, mercury, and cadmium
            into the environment, contaminating our air, soil, and water sources.
            This pollution poses significant risks to ecosystems, wildlife, and
            human populations. By promoting proper e-waste disposal and recycling,
            we can mitigate these risks and contribute to a cleaner and healthier
            planet. Through informative articles, tips, and resources, we will
            explore the environmental consequences of e-waste, the benefits of
            recycling, and practical steps individuals and businesses can take to
            reduce their e-waste footprint. Together, we can make a positive impact
            by raising awareness and fostering a culture of responsible e-waste
            management. Join us on this journey to protect our environment and build
            a sustainable future.

        <h3 class="headings">About Recycling process</h3>

        <p>
            Our recycling process for e-waste is designed to ensure the responsible
            and efficient handling of electronic devices. Once the e-waste is
            collected, we carefully dismantle each item, separating different
            components and materials. This allows us to sort and identify recyclable
            materials such as metals, plastics, and glass. Our trained technicians
            use specialized equipment to process these materials and extract
            valuable resources. Metals like copper, aluminum, and gold are extracted
            for reuse, reducing the need for new mining and minimizing the
            environmental impact. Plastics are also recycled, helping to conserve
            energy and reduce the demand for new plastic production. Additionally,
            hazardous substances such as lead and mercury are safely disposed of
            according to environmental regulations. Our recycling process follows
            strict industry standards and ensures the protection of personal data
            through secure data destruction methods. By recycling e-waste, we
            contribute to the circular economy, conserving resources, reducing
            landfill waste, and promoting a sustainable future for generations to
            come.
